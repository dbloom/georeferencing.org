## Why Georeferencing.org

Georeferencing.org is a community-driven resource dedicated to
- helping georeferencers find the tools and resources they need, and,
- allowing members of the georeferencing community to support each other by sharing resources for others to use.

Georeferencing.org is the brain-child of [VertNet](https://www.vertnet.org/){:target="_blank"} (h/t to HerpNET!) and members of the [Georefrencing Working Group](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php?title=Georeferencing_Working_Group&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop){:target="_blank"} at iDigBio. After more than a decade of developing and facilitating georeferencing workshops all around the world, we recognized that offereing a single public respository for as many georeferencing resources as we could find would be a welcome service and benefit to the broad community.

If you have resources to add to contribute share, a workshop or educational opportunity you want people to know about, or just want to report a broken link, please contact us/contact/ so we can keep this site as current as possible.

Thanks for supporting Georeferencing.org.
